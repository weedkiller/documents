<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>About This Document</h4>
<p>In <a href="Getting-Started.html">Getting Started</a> document, a new sample project is created named 
"<strong>Acme.PhoneBook</strong>". This document is a guide while developing your project. 
We definitely suggest to read this document before starting to the 
development. Since ASP.NET Zero is built on
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/" target="_blank">ASP.NET Boilerplate</a> 
application framework, this document highly refers it's 
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Before reading this document, it's suggested to run the application and explore 
the user interface. This will help you to have a better understanding of concepts defined here.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p class="auto-style1">About Server Side</p>
<p>This document is only for the <strong>Angular</strong> application. For
<strong>server side</strong>, see <a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">ASP.NET 
Core documentation</a> too.</p>
</div>
<h4>Pre Requirements</h4>
<p>Following tools are needed in order to use the solution:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Nodejs 6.9+ and Npm 3.10+</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript 2.0+</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/" target="_blank">Yarn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, see <a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">AspNet Core</a> 
documentation for server side requirements and other server side features.</p>
<h5>IDE</h5>
<p>It's suggested to use an IDE to develop your project. We used 
<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio 2017</a>, 
but you can use VS Code or any other IDE/Editor you like (VS Code, for instance). You can also use any 
OS you like (MacOS/Linux/Windows).</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>The diagram below shows the overall architecture:</p>
<p>
<img class="thumbnail" alt="Angular AspNet Core Architecture Overall" height="163" src="images/angular2-core-overall-architecture.png" width="683" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Angular </strong>project is designed so it can be <strong>
	deployed separately </strong>from the backend ASP.NET Core solution, to a 
	different port in same server or to a different server. When it's deployed, 
	it's actually a plan HTML+JS+CSS web application that can be served on any 
	operating system and any web server.</li>
	<li><strong>Angular</strong> solution consists of 2 fundamental modules:<ul>
		<li><strong>AccountModule</strong> is for login, register, remember password and so 
		on. It's mainly used to authenticate a user using TokenAuthController in 
		the server side.</li>
		<li><strong>AppModule</strong> is for authenticated users. Once a user logged in 
		successfully, they are redirected to the main application. Communication 
		performed via AJAX requests using header based token authentication.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> solution does not have any HTML, JS or CSS 
	code. It simply provides end points for token based authentication and to 
	use the application services.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Angular Solution</h4>
<p>Entrance point of the Angular solution is src/<strong>main.ts</strong>. It 
simply bootstraps the root
<a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html" target="_blank">
Angular module</a>: <strong>RootModule</strong>. Fundamental modules of the 
solution are shown below:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Angular 2 modules" height="221" src="images/ng2-modules.png" width="501" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>RootModule</strong> is responsible to bootstrap the application.</li>
	<li><strong>AccountModule</strong> provides login, two factor 
	authentication, register, password forget/reset, email activation... 
	functionalities. It's
	<a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html" target="_blank">
	lazy loaded</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>AppModule</strong> is just to group application modules and 
	provide a base layout. It contains 2 sub modules:<ul>
		<li><strong>AdminModule</strong> contains pages like user management, 
		role management, tenant management, language management, settings and so 
		on. It's lazy loaded.</li>
		<li><strong>MainModule</strong> is the main module to develop your own 
		application. It only contains a demo dashboard page which you can modify 
		or delete. It's suggested to divide your application into smaller 
		modules like we did in the startup project, instead of adding all 
		functionality into the main module. It's lazy loaded.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamental modules have their own <strong>routes</strong>. For example; 
AccountModule views start with "<strong>/account</strong>" (like 
"/account/login"), AdminModule views starts with "<strong>/app/admin</strong>" 
(like "/app/admin/users"). Angular's router lazy loads modules based on their 
url. For instance, when you request a url starts with "app/admin", the 
AdminModule and all it's components are loaded. They are not loaded if you don't 
request those pages. That brings better startup time (and also better 
development time since they are independently splitted to chunks).</p>
<p>In addition to those fundamental modules, there are some share modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>app/shared/common/<strong>app-common.module</strong>: a common 
		module used by main and admin modules as shared functionality.</li>
	<li>shared/common/<strong>common.module</strong>: A common module used by 
	account and app modules (and their sub modules).</li>
	<li>shared/utils/<strong>utils.module</strong>: Another common module used 
	by all modules (and their sub modules). We tried to collect general purpose 
	code here those can be used even in different applications.</li>
	<li>shared/service-proxies/<strong>service-proxy.module</strong>: Auto 
	generated nswag code. It's used to communicate to backend ASP.NET Core API. 
	We will see "how to generate automatic proxies" later.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>Angular solution contains src/assets/<strong>appconfig.json</strong> file 
which contains some configuration for the client side:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>remoteServiceBaseUrl</strong>: Used to configure base address of 
	the server side APIs. Default value: http://localhost:22742</li>
	<li><strong>appBaseUrl</strong>: Used to configure base address of the 
	client application. Default value: http://localhost:4200</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>appBaseUrl</strong> is configured since we use it to define format of 
our URL. If we want to use tenancy name as subdomain for a 
multi-tenant application then we can define <strong>appBaseUrl</strong> as</p>
<p>http://<strong>{TENANCY_NAME}</strong>.mydomain.com</p>
<p>{TENANCY_NAME} is the place holder here for tenant names. Tenancy name can also be 
configured for <strong>remoteServiceBaseUrl</strong> as similar. To make tenancy name subdomains properly work, we should 
also make two 
configurations beside the application:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We should configure DNS to redirect all subdomains to a static IP 
	address. To declare 'all subdomains', we can use wildcard like <strong>*.mydomain.com</strong>.</li>
	<li>We should configure IIS to bind this static IP to our application.</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other ways of doing it but this is the most simple way.</p>
<h3>AccountModule</h3>
<p><strong>AccountModule</strong> provides <strong>login</strong>, <strong>register</strong>,
<strong>forgot password </strong>and <strong>email activation</strong> pages and 
located under src/account folder:</p>
<p>
<img class="thumbnail" alt="Account Module Angular 2" height="217" src="images/ng2-account-module-files.png" width="252" /></p>
<p>
<strong>account.component</strong> is the root component of account.module.
<strong>account-routing.module</strong> defines routes for the account 
application.</p>
<h4>Login</h4>
<p>Default route for AccountModule is the login/<strong>login.component</strong>:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Login page" src="images/login-screen-3.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>tenant selection</strong> section above login section is shown only in a 
<strong>multi-tenant</strong> application and if "tenancy name detection" is 
<strong>not possible from url</strong> (for example, if you use subdomain as 
tenancy names, no need to show a tenant selection). When we click Change 
link, tenant change dialog appears and we can change the tenant. There is a single tenant named <strong>Default</strong> 
in the initial database.&nbsp;Leave tenancy name input as blank to login as <strong>host</strong>.</p>
<p>We can use <strong>admin</strong> user name and <strong>123qwe</strong> 
password in first run the application. At first login, we should change admin 
password since 123qwe is not very secure:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Change password" src="images/account-change-password-1.png" /></p>
<p>
After changing password we are redirected to the 
<strong>application</strong> (app.module).</p>
<h4>Social Logins</h4>
<p>
Social logins can be enabled and configured from
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">backend</a>. Once they are properly 
configured, they are automatically shown in the user interface. login/<strong>login.service</strong> 
implements client side logic for social logins. Note that currently only <strong>
Facebook</strong> and <strong>Google </strong>authentication is implemented for 
Angular2 application. Microsoft and Twitter logins are on the road map.</p>
<h4>Two Factor Login</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Zero is ready to provide two factor login, but it's disabled as 
default. You can easily enable it in host settings page (in Security tab):</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="" src="images/lockout-two-factor-settings-1.png" /></p>
<p>
Note: In a multi-tenant application, two factor authentication is available to 
tenants only if it's enabled in the host settings. Also, email verification and 
SMS verification settings are only available in the host side. This is by 
design.</p>
<p>
When it's enabled, user is asked to select a verification provider after 
entering user name and password:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Send security code" src="images/send-security-code-1.png" /></p>
<p>
Then a <strong>confirmation code</strong> is sent to the selected provider and 
user enters the code in the next page:</p>
<p>
<img class="thumbnail" alt="Verify security code" src="images/verify-security-code-1.png" /></p>
<h5>
Email Verification</h5>
<p>
This is available if user has a confirmed email address. Since email sending is 
disabled in debug mode, you can see the code in logs. In release mode, email 
will be sent (You can change this from <a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">
server side</a>).</p>
<h5>
SMS Verification</h5>
<p>
This is available if user has a confirmed phone number. SMS sending is not 
implemented actually (because it requires an integration to an SMS vendor). 
Current implementation just writes security code to logs. You should complete
<strong>SmsSender</strong> class in the 
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a> to make it 
usable. Otherwise, disable SMS verification in the settings.</p>
<h4>User Lockout</h4>
<p>As seen in the previous section, you can configure user lockout settings. 
Users are lockout when they enter wrong password for a specified count and 
duration.</p>
<h4>Register</h4>
<p>When we click the "<strong>Create Account</strong>" link (which is only 
available for tenants for multitenant applications) in the login page, a 
registration form is shown:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Registration form" src="images/registration-form-small-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Recaptcha</strong> (security question) is optional. It uses Google's recaptcha 
service. Recaptcha service works per domain. So, to make it properly work, you 
should create your own private and public keys for your domain on
<a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha">https://www.google.com/recaptcha</a> 
and replace keys in <strong>appsettings.json</strong> file in the
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a> and in the <strong>
appconfig.json</strong> in the client side.</p>
<h4>Email Activation</h4>
<p>When a user registers as shown above, an email confirmation code is sent to 
his email address. If user did not receive this email for some reason, they can 
click Email activation and re-send the confirmation code.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Email activation" src="images/email-activation-1.png" /></p>
<h4>Forgot Password</h4>
<p>If a user forgots his password, he can click the "Forgot Password" link to 
get an email to reset the password.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Forgot password" src="images/forgot-password-1.png" /></p>
<h4>
Tenant Registration</h4>
<p>
Tenant registration link is shown on the login form only if you are in the host 
context. When you click to the link, a registration form is shown:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant registration form" src="images/tenant-signup-v3.png" /></p>
<h3>AppModule</h3>
<p>This is the actual application module which is entered by username and password. You 
will mostly work on this application to add your business requirements. A 
screenshot from the application:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Dashboard" height="965" src="images/dashboardV3.png" width="1235" /></p>
<p>Folder structure of the source code is like that:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Angular app module files" height="450" src="images/ng2-app-module.png" width="223" /></p>
<p>It consists of 3 sub modules as described before. <strong>app.component</strong> 
is the root component for all views.</p>
<h4>Main Menu and Layout</h4>
<p>Menu and Layout files located under shared folder:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Angular layout files" src="images/ng2-layout-files-1.png" /></p>
<p>Main menu is defined and rendered in <strong>side-bar.component</strong>. You 
can add new menu items here. You generally relate a menu item to an Angular 
route. Angular routes are defined in several modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>app/admin/<strong>admin-routing.module</strong> defines routes for admin 
	module.</li>
	<li>app/main/<strong>main-routing.module</strong> defines routes for main 
	module.</li>
	<li>app/<strong>app-routing.module</strong> defines general routes and the 
	default route.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Edition Management</h4>
<p><em>If you're not developing a multi-tenant application, you can skip this 
section.</em></p>
<p>Most <strong>SaaS</strong> (multi-tenant) applications have <strong>editions</strong> (packages) those have different 
<strong>features</strong>. Thus, they can provide different <strong>price and feature options</strong> to thier tenants (customers).&nbsp;<strong>Editions 
page</strong> (available in host login)<strong> </strong>is used to manage 
application's editions:</p>
<p>
<img  class="img-thumbnail" alt="Editions Page" src="images/editions-page-core-4.png" /></p>
<p>Editions are used to group feature values and assign to tenants. When we 
click Actions/Edit for an edition, we can see it&#39;s poperties:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Edit Edition" src="images/edition-edit-1.png" /></p>
<p>
An edition can be free or paid. If it&#39;s a paid edition then you should enter 
monthly and annual prices. You can allow tenants to use trial version of this 
edition for a specified days. Then you can determine an expire strategy: How 
many days to allow a tenant to use the application after subscription expires. 
And finally, you can deactivate tenant or assign to a free edition if they don&#39;t 
extend their subscription.</p>
<p>Features tab is used to determing features available for the edition:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Edit edition features" src="images/edition-feature-editing-core-1.png" /></p>
<p>See
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Feature-Management">
feature management</a> and
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Edition-Management">
edition management</a> documents for more information.</p>

<h4>Tenant Management</h4>

<div class="note note-info">
<p><em>If you're not developing a multi-tenant application, you can skip this 
section.</em></p>
</div>

<p>If this is a multi-tenant application and you logged in as a host user, then 
tenants page is shown:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail"  alt="Tenant management page" src="images/tenant-management-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>A tenant is represented by <strong>Tenant</strong> class. Tenant class 
<a href="Extending-Existing-Entities.html">can be 
extended</a> by adding new properties. There is an only 
one tenant, named <strong>Default</strong> as initial.<strong> Tenancy Name</strong> (code name, 
which can be used as subdomain) is the <strong>unique</strong> name 
of a tenant. A&nbsp;tenant can be <strong>active</strong> or <strong>passive</strong>. 
If it's passive, no user of this tenant can login to the application.</p>
<p>When we 
click the "<strong>Create New Tenant</strong>" button, a dialog is shown:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant Creation Modal" src="images/tenant-create-modal-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Tenancy name</strong> should be unique and can not contain spaces or 
other special chars since it may be used as subdomain name (like 
tenancyname.mydomain.com). <strong>Name</strong> can be anything. <strong>Admin email</strong> 
is used as email address of the admin user of new tenant. Admin user is 
automatically created with the tenant. We can set a random password for admin and send activation email. When user 
first logins, they should change the password. We can uncheck this to enter a known 
password.</p>
<p>When we create a new tenant, we should select/create a database to store new 
tenant's data. We can select '<strong>Use host database</strong>' to store 
tenant data in host database (can be used for single database approach) or we 
can specify a connection string to create/use a <strong>dedicated database
</strong>for new tenant. AspNet Zero supports <strong>hybrid </strong>approach. 
That means you can use host database for some tenants and create dedicated 
databases for some other tenants. Even you can <strong>group </strong>some 
tenants in a separated database.</p>
<p>Once you assign an edition to the tenant, you can select an expiration date 
(see edition management section to know what happens after subscription 
expiration).</p>
<h5>Tenant Edition and Features</h5>
<p>An <strong>edition</strong> can be <strong>assigned</strong> to a tenant 
(while creating or editing). Tenant will inherit all features of the assigned 
edition, but we can also override features and values for a tenant. Click
<strong>actions/change features</strong> for a tenant to <strong>customize</strong> 
it's features:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant features" src="images/tenant-features-core-1.png" /></p>
<h5>Tenant User Impersonation</h5>
<p>As a host user, we may want to perform operations in behalf of a tenant. In 
this case, we can click the "<strong>Login 
as this tenant</strong>" button in the actions. When we click it, we see <strong>a modal to select a user</strong> of the 
tenant. We can select any user and perform operations allowed that user. See
<strong>User Impersonation</strong> section in this document for more 
information.</p>
<h5>Using Tenancy Name As Subdomain</h5>
<p>A multi-tenant application generally uses subdomain to identify current tenant.
<strong>tenant1</strong>.mydomain.com, <strong>tenant2</strong>.mydomain.com and 
so on. ASP.NET Zero automatically identify and get tenant name from subdomain. 
See application configuration section.</p>
<h4>Host Dashboard</h4>
<p>Host dashboard is used to show some statistics about tenants, editions and 
income:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Host dashboard" height="495" src="images/host-dashboard-1.png" width="1200" /></p>
<p>This is a fully implemented dashboard except two sample statistics (sample 
statistics 1 &amp; 2) those are placeholders for your own statistics.</p>
<h4>Organization Units</h4>
<p>Organization units (OU) are used to hierarchically group user and entities. 
Then you can get user or entities based on their OUs. When we click 
Administration/Organization units, we enter the related page:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Organization units page" src="images/organization-units-page-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>Here, we can manage OUs (create, edit, delele, move) and members 
(add/remove).</p>
<p>In the left OU tree, we can <strong>right click</strong> to an OU (or left click to
<strong>arrow</strong> at the right) to open <strong>context menu</strong> for 
OU operations. We can also add new members with the upper right button of 
members area.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Select a user dialog" src="images/select-user-lookup-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>This is actually a <strong>generic lookup modal</strong> and can be used to 
select any type of entity (see app/shared/common/lookup/<strong>common-lookup-modal.component</strong>).</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Organization-Units">
organization unit management document</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>Role Management</h4>

<p>When we click Administration/Roles menu, we enter to the role management page:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Role management page" src="images/role-management-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>Roles are used to <strong>group permissions</strong>. When a user has a 
role, then they will have all permissions of that role.</p>
<p>A role is represented by the <strong>Role</strong> class. Role class 
<a href="Extending-Existing-Entities.html">can be 
extended</a> by adding new properties.</p>
<p>Roles can be 
dynamic or static:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Static role</strong>: A static role has a known <strong>name
	</strong>(like 'admin') and can not change this name (we can change <strong>
	display name</strong>). It's exists on the system startup and can not be 
	deleted. Thus, we can write codes based on a static role name.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic role</strong>: We can create a dynamic role 
	after deployment. Then we can grant permissions for that role, we can assign 
	the role to some users and we can delete it. We can not know names of 
	dynamic roles in development time.</li>
</ul>

<p>One or more roles can be set as <strong>default</strong>. Default roles are 
assigned to new added/registered users as default. This is not a development 
time property and can be set or changed after deployment.</p>

<p>In startup project, we have static <strong>admin </strong>role for host (for 
multi-tenant apps). Also, we have static <strong>admin </strong>and <strong>user </strong>
roles for tenants. <strong>Admin </strong>roles have all permissions granted by 
default. <strong>User </strong>role is the <strong>default</strong> role for new users and has no 
permission by default. These can be changed easily in the
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>.</p>
<h5>Role Permissions</h5>
<p>Since roles are used to group permissions, we can set permissions of a role 
while creating or editing as shown below:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Role Permissions" src="images/role-permissions-core-1.png" /></p>
<p>(not all permissions shown in the figure above)</p>
<p>Every tenant has it's <strong>own roles</strong> and any change in roles for a tenant does not effect other 
tenants. Also, host has also it's own isolated roles.</p>
<h4>User Management</h4>

<p>When we click Administration/Users menu, we enter to the user management page:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User management" src="images/user-management-core-3.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Users</strong> are people who can <strong>login </strong>to the application and 
perform some operations based on their <strong>permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>A user can have zero or more <strong>roles</strong>. If a user has more than 
one role, he inherits union of 
permissions of all these roles. Also, we can set <strong>user-specific permission</strong>. 
A user specific permission setting overrides role settings for this permission. 
A screenshot of user permission dialog:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User Permissions" src="images/user-permissions-1.png" /></p>
<p>(not all permissions shown in the figure above)</p>
<p>A dialog is used to create/edit a user:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Editing User" src="images/edit-user-3.png" /></p>
<p>We can change user's <strong>password</strong>, make her <strong>
active/passive</strong> and so on... A user can have a <strong>profile picture</strong>. 
It can be changed by the user (See User Menu section). <strong>Admin</strong> 
user can not be deleted as a business rule. If you don't want to use admin, just make it 
inactive.</p>
<h5>User Impersonation</h5>
<p>As admin (or any allowed user), we may want to login as a user and perform 
operations in behalf of that user, without knowing his password. When we click "<strong>Login as this user</strong>" 
icon in the actions of a user, we are automatically redirected and logged in as this user. 
This is called as "<strong>user impersonation</strong>". When we impersonate a user, a "<strong>back to 
my account</strong>" option is added to the user profile menu:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Back to my account link" src="images/back-to-my-account-link-3.png" /></p>
<p>In an impersonated account, we can only perform operations allowed to that 
user. That means, everything <strong>exactly</strong> works as same as this user 
logged in himself. The only difference is shown in audit logs which indicates 
that operations are performed by somebody else. Notice that; Also a <strong>red 
'back' icon</strong> shown near to the user name to indicate that you are in an 
impersonated account.</p>
<h4>Language Management</h4>
<p>Language management page is used to manage (add/edit/delete) <strong>application 
languages</strong> and change <strong>localized texts</strong>:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Language management" src="images/language-list-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>We can create new language, edit/delete an existing language and <strong>set a 
language as default</strong>. Note that; tenants can not edit/delete default 
languages, but host users can do.</p>
<p>When we click to <strong>Change text</strong> for any language, we are 
redirected to a new view to edit language texts:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Language texts" src="images/language-change-text-modal-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>We can select any language as a <strong>base</strong> (reference) and change 
<strong>target</strong> language's 
texts. Base language is just to help the translation progress. Since there maybe different
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization#DocLocalizationSources">
localization sources</a>, we select the source to translate. When we click the 
edit icon, we can see the edit modal for the selected text:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Language text editing" src="images/language-change-text-modal-core-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Host</strong> users (if allowed) can edit languages and localized 
texts. These languages will be default for all tenants for a multi-tenant application.
<strong>Tenants</strong> inherit languages and localized texts and can <strong>
override</strong> localized texts or can add new languages.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Language-Management">
language management</a> and
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization" target="_blank">
localization</a> documents for more information.</p>
<h4>Audit Logs</h4>
<p>In audit logs page, we can see all user interactions with the application:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Audit logs" src="images/audit-logs-core-3.png" /></p>
<p>All application service methods and MVC controller actions are automatically logged and can be viewed 
here. See
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Audit-Logging">audit 
logs documentation</a> to learn how to configure it. When we click the magnifier 
icon, we can see all details an audit log:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Audit Log" src="images/audit-logs-detail-1.png" /></p>
<p>
Audit log report is provided by <strong>AuditLogAppService</strong> class.</p>
<h4>
Subscription</h4>
<p>
Tenants can manage (show, extend or upgrade) their edition/plan subscriptions using this page:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Subscription" src="images/subscription-1.png" /></p>
<p>All payment records for extending/upgrading current licenses are kept in the system. These records can be seen on "Payment History" tab on subscription page.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Payment History" src="images/subscription-payment-history-core.png" />
</p>
<p>
Tenants can also create &amp; print invoices for these payments by clicking the "Show Invoice" button. System will automatically generate an invoice number and show the generated invoice.
In order to use this function, both Host &amp; Tenant must set invoice informations on host setting/tenant setting page.
</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant Invoice Settings" src="images/host-settings-invoice.png" />
</p>
<p>After all, invoices for payments related to subscription can be generated. You can see a sample invoice below:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Sample Invoice" src="images/sample-invoice-core.png" />
</p>
<h4>Visual Settings</h4>
<p>AspNet Zero's look of UI can be modified in visual settings page. This page is used to modify look of UI both for system and personal user accounts. If a user doesn't have permission to see this page, then user will see an item named "Visual Settings" in his personal menu.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User visual settings" src="images/user-menu-visual-settings-core.png" />
</p>
<p>Users who have permission to see this page will see the same item in the application menu.</p>
<p>In this page, users can change visual settings for Layout, Header, Menu and 
Footer of the application.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Visual settings" src="images/visual-settings-core.png" />
</p>

<h4>Host Settings</h4>
<p>Host settings page is used to configure some system settings:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="General Host Settings" src="images/host-settings-general-6.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Timezone</strong> is an important setting in this page. AspNet 
Zero can work in multiple zones. Each user can see dates and times in their own time zone. Timezone setting in this 
page allows you to set default time zone for the application including all 
tenants and users. Tenants and users can change time zone in their own settings. 
Timezone setting is available only if you are using UTC clock.
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Timing" target="_blank">
See documentation</a> to switch to UTC.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> tab in host settings page contains password complexity settings. Host can define system wide password complexity settings in this tab. Each tenant can override this setting in tenant settings page.</p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant settings" src="images/host-settings-security-3.png" />
<h4>Tenant Settings</h4>
<p>In a multi-tenant application, tenant settings are shown as below:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant settings" src="images/tenant-settings-core-1.png" /></p>
<p>If we disable multi-tenancy, some host settings are also shown in this page (since 
there is no host setting page). Tenants can also define password complexity settings for their users or they can use password complexity settings defined by host user.</p>
<h5>Enabling LDAP (Active Directory) Authentication</h5>
<p>LDAP (Active Directory) Authentication is disabled by default. To make it 
work, we should <strong>disable multi-tenancy</strong> since LDAP auth is not 
used in a multi-tenant system normally. See
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a> to enable LDAP. Once we 
enable, we can see <strong>LDAP settings</strong> section in the settings page:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="LDAP Settings" src="images/tenant-settings-ldap-1.png" /></p>
<p>We can check "<strong>Enable LDAP Authentication</strong>" to enable it. If 
the server works in domain and application runs with a domain user or local 
system, then generally even <strong>no need</strong> to set Domain name, user and password. You 
can logout and then login with your <strong>domain user name and password</strong>. 
If not, you should set these credentials.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>.Net Core Compability</strong></p>
<p>LDAP Authentication is not supportted by .net core yet. Thus, it's designed 
to be conditional. If you are using .Net Framework (4.6+) then it will be 
available, otherwise it will be disabled.</p>
</div>
<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>Maintenance page is available to <strong>host side</strong> for multi tenant 
applications (for single tenant applications it's shown in tenant side) and shown as 
below:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Maintenance cache" src="images/maintenance-cache-1.png" /></p>
<p>In the <strong>Caches</strong> tab, we can clear some or all caches. Clearing 
caches may be needed if you manually change database and want to refresh 
application cache. <strong>Website Logs</strong> tab is used to see and download 
logs: </p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Maintenance logs" src="images/maintenance-logs-1.png" /></p>

<h4>Tenant Dashboard</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Zero startup project also includes a <strong>sample</strong> 
dashboard. It's just for demo purposes, you can make it as a start point for 
your actual dashboard. It's implemented with app/main/<strong>dashboard.component</strong> 
in <strong>main.module</strong>.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Dashboard" height="965" src="images/dashboardV3.png" width="1235" /></p>
<p>Client gets all data from server, server generates random data.</p>
<h4>Notifications</h4>
<p>Notification icon is located next to the language selection button. The number in the red circle shows unread notification count.</p>
<p>
<img alt="notifications" src="images/notifications-icon-1.png" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>
<p>User can see 3 recent notifications by clicking this icon. </p>
<p>
<img alt="notifications" src="images/recent-notifications-1.png" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>
<p>User can marks all notifications as read by clicking the "Set all as read" link or can mark a single notification by clicking the "set as read" link next to each notification.</p>
<p>Notifications are sent real-time using SignalR. In addition, a <strong>
desktop push notification</strong> is shown when a notification is received.</p>
<h5>Notification Settings</h5>
<p>"Settings" link opens notification settings dialog.</p>
<p>
<img alt="notifications" src="images/notification-settings-1.png" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>
<p>In this dialog there is a global setting for user to enable/disable receiving notifications. If this setting is enabled, then user can enable/disable each notification individually.</p>
<p>You can also define your custom notifications in the
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>. See <a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Notification-System">notifications documentation</a> for detailed information.</p>
<h5>Notification List</h5>
<p>All notifications of the user are listed in this page.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Notification list" src="images/notifications-list-core-3.png" /></p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>.Net Core Compability</strong></p>
<p>Since SignalR is not ready yet for .net core, real time notifications will 
not work if you select .net core as your base framework.</p>
</div>

<h4>Chat</h4>
<p>Chat icon is located next to user's profile image on top right corner of the page.  The number in the red circle shows total unread chat message count.</p>
<p><img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/chat-icon-1.png" /></p>
<p>When user clicks this icon, chat panel appears on the right of page. This panel contains friends of user and list of blocked users.</p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/chat-friends-1.png" />
<p>User can add new friends by writing the username into username textbox above friend list. If "Chat with other tenants" feature is enabled for tenant, users of other tenants can be added as a friend by writing [tenancy name]\[user name] (ex: Default\admin). If "Chat with host users" feature is enabled, host users can be added as friend by writing .\[user name] in the same textbox.</p>
<p>While online friends/users have a green circle on their profile image, offline friends/users 
have a gray circle.</p>
<p>User can pin or unpin the chat panel by clicking the pin icon on top right corner of the chat panel. Application tries to remember last state of chat panel and restores it when user login to application.</p>
<p>When a friend/user is selected, conversation panel is opened.</p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/chat-conversation-1.png" />
<p>Chat system also allows sending images, files and link of current page to friends</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Chat attachments" src="images/chat-attachments-core.png" />
</p>

<p>User can block or unblock friend/user in this area. There is a wrench icon right of the selected user's username. This icon opens an action menu and this menu contains block user or unblock user actions according to user's block status.</p>
<h5>Chat Features</h5>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/chat-features-1.png" />
<p>There are three chat features in the system. These are "Chat", "Chat with host", "Chat with other tenants". These features can be enabled/disabled 
per edition/tenant. By using these features host can enable/disable chat with other tenant's users or host users.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>.Net Core Compability</strong></p>
<p>Since SignalR is not ready yet for .net core, chat feature will 
not work if you select .net core as your base framework.</p>
</div>
<h4>User Menu</h4>
<p>A user can click his name at top right corner to open user menu:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/user-menu-4.png" /></p>
<h5>Linked Accounts</h5>
<p>Linked accounts are used to link multiple accounts to each other. In this 
way, a user can easily navigate through his accounts using this feature.</p>
<p>User can link new accounts or delete already linked accounts by clicking the 
"Manage accounts" link.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User menu" src="images/linked-accounts-3.png" /></p>
<p>
In order to link a new account, user must enter login credentials of related account.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="link new account" src="images/link-new-account-1.png"/></p>
<h5>Profile Settings</h5>
<p>My settings is used to change user profile settings:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="User settings" src="images/user-settings-3.png" /></p>
<p>As shown here, <strong>admin</strong> user name can not be changed. It's 
considered a special user name since it's used in database migration seed. Other 
users can change their usernames.</p>
<h5>Login Attempts</h5>
<p>All login attempts (success of failed) are logged in the application. A user 
can see last login attempts for his/her account.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Login attempts" src="images/login-attempts-1.png" /></p>
<h5>Change Picture</h5>
<p>A user can change own profile picture. Currently, jpg/jpeg, gif and png files are supported, you can extend it.</p>
<h4>Setup Page</h4>
<p>
AspNet Zero application can be set-up using install page. This page is developed to create initial database, apply migrations and configure the application according to user's input on this page.
Setup page can be accessed via <strong>http://yourwebsite.com/app/admin/install</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="install page" src="images/install-page-core.png" width="1200" />
</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<h4>NPM Packages</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Zero solution supports both <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">
yarn</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">
npm</a> to obtain front end library dependencies (like angular and bootstrap). We suggest to use yarn because npm has some problems, yarn solves those problems and it is compatible with npm as well. You can easily add, update or remove packages 
on yarn's command line interface.</p>
<h4>Angular CLI &amp; WebPack</h4>
<p>AspNet Zero uses <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">
angular-cli</a> for the development and deployment. It's properly configured for 
angular-cli and already working. To run the application, open command line and 
type "<strong>npm start</strong>" command (or "npm run hmr" to enable hot module 
replacement feature). Once it's compiled and ready, you can 
go to <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a> to open the 
application in your browser. See <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">angular-cli</a> 
official web site for more.</p>
<h4>NSwag</h4>
<p>Since all communication to server made via AJAX requests, we are using a 
client side javascript layer to call server API. It's automatically generated by
<a href="https://github.com/NSwag/NSwag">nswag</a> tool using
<a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_blank">swagger</a>. AspNet Zero solution 
is properly configured for nswag. When you change your server side services, all 
you need to do is to run <strong>nswag/refresh.bat</strong> file (or run the command inside it 
for a non-Windows OS) while server side (.Host project) is running.</p>
<p>Generated code is located in shared/service-proxies/<strong>service-proxies</strong>.ts 
file. You should not make manual change in this file since it will be overritten 
on the next code generation.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>Refreshing Service Proxies</strong></p>
<p>While Nswag automatically generate proxy files, it does not refresh <strong>
service-proxies.module</strong>.ts. If you add a new service, you should <strong>
manually</strong> add it to this file as like others.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h4>AppComponentBase</h4>
<p>If you inherit your components from <strong>AppComponentBase</strong> class, 
you can get many commonly used services as pre-injected (like localization, 
permission checker, feature checker, ui notify/message, settings and so on...). 
For example; you can just use <strong>l(...)</strong> function In views and
<strong>this.l(...)</strong> 
function in component classes for localization. See pre-built components for 
example usages.</p>
<h4>Localization</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Zero <strong>User Interface</strong> is completely
localized. AspNet Zero uses <strong>dynamic, database based, per-tenant</strong> 
localization.</p>
<p>XML files are used as base translation for desired languages (defined in the
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>):</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Localization XML files" src="images/localization-files-core-1.png" /></p>
<p>PhoneBook will be your ProjectName. You can add more XML files by copying one 
XML file and translate to desired language. See
<a href="http://www.csharp-examples.net/culture-names/" target="_blank">valid 
culture codes</a>.</p>
<p>When you are adding a new localizable text, add it to the XML file of the 
default language then use in your application (Also, add translated values to 
corresponding XML files). No need to add it to database migration code since 
value in the XML file will be used as default. See
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a> documentation for more.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization">
localization</a> and
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Language-Management">
language management</a> documentations for more information 
on localization.</p>
<h4>Exception Handling</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Zero uses ABP's
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/AspNet-Core#exception-filter" target="_blank">
exception handling</a> system. Thus, you don't need to handle &amp; care about 
exceptions in most time. All server side exceptions are gracefuly handled and an 
appropriate message is shown to the user.</p>
<h4>Authorization</h4>
<p>You can inject and use PermissionCheckerService to check user permissions. 
It's pre injected for AppComponentBase (permission field) and also you can use 
shortcut isGranted function. Permissions are defined in
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>. 
See authorization
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Authorization">
documentation</a> for more.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>You can inject and use FeatureCheckerService to check tenant features. It's 
pre injected for AppComponentBase (feature field). Features are defined in
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>. 
See feature management
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Feature-Management">
documentation</a> for more.</p>
<h4>Setting</h4>
<p>You can inject and use SettingService to check settings. It's pre injected 
for AppComponentBase (setting field). Settings are defined in
<a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a>. 
See setting management
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Setting-Management">
documentation</a> for more.</p>
<h4>SignalR Integration</h4>
<p>SignalR is properly configured and integrated to the startup project. Real 
time notification and chat systems use it. You can also direcly use SignalR in your 
applications.</p>
<p>Notice that; As the time being, SignalR
<a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap#12">has not been released</a> 
for ASP.NET Core yet. We integrated <strong>OWIN</strong> to ASP.NET Core 
pipeline in order to use SignalR in the application.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/SignalR-Integration">
SignalR integration</a> document for more information.</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>.Net Core Compability</strong></p>
<p>Since SignalR is not ready yet for .net core, SignalR integration is disabled if you select .net core as your base framework.</p>
</div>
<h3>Token Based Authentication</h3>
<p>AspNet Zero Angular UI uses the <a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server 
side</a> via token based authentication. Any application can authenticate and 
use any functionality in the application as API. For instance, you can create a 
mobile application consumes the same API. In this section, we'll demonstrate 
usage of the API from
<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank">Postman</a> 
(a Google Chrome extension).</p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>We suggest you to disable two factor authentication for the user which will 
be used for remote authentication. Otherwise, two factor authentication flow 
should be implemented by the client. You can check account module source code to 
understand the flow. We assume that you have disabled two factor authentication for the <strong>admin</strong> 
user of <strong>default</strong> tenant since we will use it in this sample.</p>
<p>Following headers should be configured for all requests (Abp.TenantId is Id 
of the default tenant. This is not required for single tenant applications or if 
you want to work with host users):</p>
<p>
<img alt="Postman auth headers" height="112" src="images/postman-ng2-auth-headers.png" width="523" /></p>
<p>Then we can send username and password as a <strong>POST</strong> request to
http://localhost:22742<strong>/api/TokenAuth/Authenticate</strong></p>
<p>
<a href="http://localhost:22742/api/TokenAuth/Authenticate:">
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Postman authentication" height="1040" src="images/postman-ng2-auth.png" width="746" /></a></p>
<p>
In the returning response, <strong>accessToken</strong> will be used to 
authorize for the API.</p>
<h4>Using API</h4>
<p>After authenticate and get the access token, we can use it to call any <strong>authorized</strong> 
actions. All <strong>services </strong>are available to be used remotely. For 
example, we can use the <strong>User service</strong> to get a <strong>list of 
users</strong>:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Postman get user list" height="1040" src="images/postman-ng2-userlist.png" width="755" /></p>
<p>We sent a GET request to http://localhost:22742<strong>/api/services/app/User/GetUsers</strong> 
and added Authorization to the header as "<strong>Bearer &lt;accessToken&gt;</strong>". 
Returning JSON contains the list of users.</p>
<h3>Swagger UI</h3>
<p><a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a> is 
<strong>integrated</strong> to ASP.NET Zero <strong>by default</strong>. You can browse <strong>swagger ui</strong> 
from http://localhost:22742<strong>/swagger/ui/</strong> URL. Notice that this 
is <a href="Development-Guide-Core.html">server side</a> URL of the application. 
In this page (which is the default page of server side API application) you can 
see all available API:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Swagger UI" src="images/swagger-ui-ng2-1.png" /></p>
<h3>
Deployment</h3>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>About Deployment</strong></p>
<p>
If you have merged Angular UI project into ASP.NET Core project then you only 
need to publish your .Host project.</p>
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<p><strong>Email Settings</strong></p>
<p>
If you don't configure email settings, some functions may not work (Like new tenant registration).</p>
</div>


<p>
We are using <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">angular-cli</a> 
for development &amp; deployment. Angular CLI has it's own build command that can be 
used to build your application:</p>
<pre>ng build -prod</pre>
<p>
This command uses <strong>dist</strong> folder as output. Just remember to 
change
<strong>assets/appconfig.json</strong> file with your own configuration.</p>
<h4>
AOT</h4>
<p>
Angular CLI uses <strong>
<a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html" target="_blank">
AOT</a> (Ahead of Time)</strong> Compilation by default. You can add --no-aot 
parameter to ng build command to disable it. But we recommend AOT since it has 
significiant performance gain.</p>
<h4>
IIS Deploy</h4>
<p>
After ng build command, dist folder contains all necessary files to create a web 
site under IIS. One important thing is that; Angular uses client side routing. 
If you refresh a page (F5) then IIS will handle the request and naturally can 
not find the requested path and returns a HTTP 404 error. We should configure 
IIS to redirect all requests to the index.html page (or, to the root path).</p>
<p>
AspNet Zero Angular UI contains a <strong>web.config</strong> file. You can copy 
it to the web site's root folder to overcome the problem described above.</p>

<h3>Used Library &amp; Frameworks</h3>
